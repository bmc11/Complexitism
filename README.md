# Complexitism

Complexitism is a science-driven philosophy based on the recognized need for humans to form a holistic worldview and a hope for the future that necessarily expands beyond the current limits of scientific knowledge.  Some Complexitists identify Complexitism as their religion.

Complexitism derives its name from the concept that fundamental laws of the universe determine that very large non-complex systems will form complex systems and patterns naturally.  [Current scientific study](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-new-physics-theory-of-life/) is being conducted in this field.  This macro perspective of evolution applies to all areas of the universe including both biological (such as living organisms) and non-biological (such as planets, stars and galaxies).

## *** CONTRIBUTORS ARE NEEDED ***  
Complexitism is a philosophy concerning how a multitude of independent forces work together to create a complex system.  The Complexitist philosophy should also be sourced from as many individuals as possible.  Please contribute ideas and references as much as possible!  We especially need more scientific references.  This is the philosophy of the entire human species, not any one small group.
