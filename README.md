# Complexitism

Complexitism is a science-driven philosophy based on the recognized need for humans to form a holistic worldview and a hope for the future that necessarily expands beyond the current limits of scientific knowledge.  Some Complexitists identify Complexitism as their religion.

Complexitism derives its name from the concept that fundamental laws of the universe determine that very large non-complex systems will form complex systems and patterns naturally.  This macro perspective of evolution applies to all areas of the universe including both biological (such as living organisms) and non-biological (such as planets, stars and galaxies).
