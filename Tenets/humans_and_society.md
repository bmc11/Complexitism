# Humans & Society

Complexitists, as a recognition of a fundamental nature of the universe, seek to further the complexity of systems.  Complexitists see themselves as components of this larger natural progression and they seek to move with that progression by increasing the complexity of systems within and around themselves.  Complexitists define “good” as that which increases complexity in a system.

Complexitism currently believes that the best evidence suggests that well-regulated free economies and cultures are the most productive and innovative.  Because productivity and innovation are general movements of less order to order in a system, Complexitists believe that productivity and innovation are good, and therefore societies should strive to promote well-regulated free economies and cultures.

Complexitists recognize that past and current religions are a natural outcome of complex brains and complex societies, and therefore these religions should be studied, understood, and respected, even if the tenets of those religions contradict current scientific theories and should not define current human actions.
