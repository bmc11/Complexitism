# Humans & The Universe

Complexitists recognize that reality is likely to be so complex that it is possible to perceive it very differently than it is currently perceived by humans.

These possible perceptions cannot contradict current scientific theory, but could possibly overshadow all current scientific theories to a level of near insignificance.


For example, just as the neurons of a brain are highly complex but are merely a single cell within a collective whose whole appears to be greater than the sum of its parts, so could all humans (and all other organisms and objects in the known universe) merely be small components to a much larger, more complex collective that could create the epiphenomenon of consciousness at a level not understandable to our own.  This acknowledgement opens the possibility to a great deal of theories concerning the nature of the universe that can be accommodated by Complexitism.  However, these theories cannot contradict any currently known scientific theory.
