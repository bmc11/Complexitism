# Buddhist Complexitists

Buddhist Complexitists are generally very similar to [Open Complexitists](https://github.com/complexitism/Complexitism/blob/master/Philosophies/open_complexitists.md) with the added belief that humans can achieve happiness and end suffering through enlightenment and a type of perception of dependent origination and the Four Noble Truths.
