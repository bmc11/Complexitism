# Christian Complexitists

Christian Complexitists are generally very liberal Christians who believe that a universal consciousness does exist and that the Judeo-Christian higher concepts of this being are the most correct of all other historical religions.

Most Christian Complexitists do believe that a man named Jesus existed in first century Judea and that he somehow tapped into a part of the universal consciousness.
