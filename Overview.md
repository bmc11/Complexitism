# Complexitism Overview

Complexitism is a science-driven philosophy, based on the recognized need for humans to form a holistic worldview and a hope for the future that necessarily expands beyond the current limits of scientific knowledge.  Some Complexitists identify Complexitism as their religion.

Complexitism derives its name from the concept that fundamental laws of the universe determine that very large non-complex systems will form complex systems and patterns naturally.  This macro perspective of evolution applies to all areas of the universe including both biological (such as living organisms) and non-biological (such as planets, stars and galaxies).


## The Science of Complexitism

Complexitism is science-driven because it does not permit perspectives that contradict the best current theories of scientific understanding.  Complexitism, at its core, is defined by scientific theories, and all extra hypotheses and conjectures derive from hard science.  Any forms of Complexitism belief that contradict the best current scientific theories must be deconstructed and, if appropriate, reconstructed in alignment with the best current scientific theories.

The core concept of Complexitism, that all large systems gain complexity over time, is a science-based [hypertheory] (https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hypertheoretical) (a theory that extends a scientific theory to a logical conclusion not yet approved through scientific testing).  All hypertheories of Complexitism must be logical outcomes of a confirmed scientific theory (preferably multiple theories), and cannot contradict any current theory.

Complexitism owes its origins to all contributors of evolution-type concepts including [Jean-Baptiste Lamarck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamarckism) and [Charles Darwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species). More [recent scientific hypotheses] (https://www.quantamagazine.org/20140122-a-new-physics-theory-of-life/) continue to support the core ideas of Complexitism.

## The Religion of Complexitism

Complexitism is acknowledged to be religious because it is holds logical beliefs that are not (yet) scientifically confirmed.  Complexitists are self-aware enough to recognize that no human can navigate the complex variables of life without holding assumptions about reality that extend beyond current scientific knowledge.  However, Complexitists strive to not hold any beliefs that contradict current scientific knowledge.  

Religion can be [“a set of beliefs concerning the cause, nature, and purpose of the universe”](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/religion) and [“the body of persons adhering to a particular set of beliefs and practices.”](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/religion)  Complexitists recognize that hope for the future necessarily includes assumptions not scientifically verified, and that these extra-scientific [beliefs](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/belief) fall under a type of religion, even if it is strongly evidence-based.

Most Complexitists acknowledge that if Natural Complexity Theory is true (the core concept of Complexitism that less complexity leads to more complexity naturally in a large system), then it is possible that intelligent life will eventually reach a state of consciousness that is not encumbered by the need for a physical body (perhaps existing as organized photons, or an even more fundamental state).  This state of consciousness tied with the possibility for incredible spacetime manipulation due to advanced technologies opens the possibility for what was formerly known as "supernatural" beings.  Some Complexitists believe that humans, unless driven to extinction, will eventually reach a state of collective consciousness at this level.  Some Complexitists believe this concept of highly advanced collective conscious states opens the door to numerous religious concepts.  Other Complexitists (Natural Complexitists and some Open Complexitists) reject this religious-type concept. Technology is the gateway which has advanced communications and should provide a foundation to reach higher states of consciousness intuned with Nature and humanity as one. Dreams and subconscious will be directly accessible with help from loved ones and intimate connectivity to further understand Natures design, intent and meaning. Every individual has a personal perspective that is valuable as variety and diversity are Natures way of adapting existence in this universe.
